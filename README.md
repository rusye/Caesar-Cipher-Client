# Caesar Cipher Client Side

## Description

In cryptography, a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The client **WILL NOT** work without the server, it can be found [here](https://github.com/rusye/Caesar-Cipher-Server).

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rusye/Caesar-Cipher-Client.git
```

## Running the app

```bash
$ ng serve --open
```

## Using the app

When the app loads, you will see two inputs, they are both required, in the first input you will enter the input you would like to encrypt and in the second input you will enter the amount you would like to shift it by.

After you have submitted your encryption request you will get the result right below and you will also be shown your previous encryption requests.
